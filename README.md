Backwards Q-learning
The pdf file Backward_q discusses theory, method and results. It was written by me, Denisa Apetroaei together with my lab partner Fiesta Leung. 
I was responsible for the code and data analysis.
The code files include the simulation environment, changes made to it for better calculations of the reward function, the class defined for the chosen algorithm and the training python files.
Attached are also the plots comparing choice of different constants.
